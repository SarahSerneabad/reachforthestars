		<p>The little girl has come across two planets. She must travel to one of these planets to refuel. One of the planets, Saturn, has another stranded little girl who wants to reach for the stars as well, but is stranded. The other planet, Mars, has a shiny, gold starcoin (the currency of the starworld). Where should she go?</p>
